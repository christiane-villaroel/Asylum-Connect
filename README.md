# Asylum Connect:
Our product aims at not only helping migrants with finding interpreters but also with all other manners of language translation.  From translating messages to offering language learning courses, our app strives to empower asylum seekers with the language skills they need to navigate various aspects of their lives in a new country.  

## Development Status:

- Currently we have the design build complete for our website.
- The build track of our website is still under development and unfortunately will not be ready for deployment
### Tech Stack:
- We will be using a RESTful API for our project. 
- The Backend will be built using Flask (Python Framework)
- The Frontend will be build using React (JavaScript Library)

#### Tech Stack Reasoning:
- Since we had limited time learning a backend langauge with a simple syntax was the optimal choice for us. 
- As well as choosing to use the Flask framework, as it is light weight and easy to use to build an API to handle request from the client side
- We chose React Js for the Frontend side for its reusable components, which will enable us to break down our UI into smaller pies and avoid repeating the same code on another page.
